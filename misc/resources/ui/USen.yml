  This course will be reported to the OCW admins.

  Note that we do not delete levels for glitches or unfair
  mechanics. However, if you believe a course is legitimately
  not possible to clear, we may prevent it from appearing in
  Endless mode.

  We will also delete courses for inappropriate content or
  copying.

  Congratulations on setting up OCW!

  Open Course World (OCW) is not affiliated with Nintendo.
  We are a fan-run archive intended for levels that Nintendo
  would otherwise take down.

  By uploading a course, you agree to OCW's user agreement,
  which can be found at https://opencourse.world/eula

  Levels from Nintendo Switch Online are NOT available
  on OCW, unless the creator of that level has explicitly
  provided that level to us. If you would like to play a
  level that is not on OCW, please contact the level creator.

  Do not upload courses that you did not create to
  Open Course World unless you have explicit permission from
  the creator of that level. Violations of this rule will result
  in a ban.

  We expect you to be playing from a legally purchased copy
  of Mario Maker 2, on your own hardware. If you are found
  to be using a pirated copy, you will be banned.

  OCW will not delete levels for glitches, but we ask that if
  a level is not clearable, that you mark it as exempt from
  endless mode via our website.
